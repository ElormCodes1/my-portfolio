            I'm your go-to developer for all things web-related. With a focus on
            Next.js and React, I wield these frameworks like a pro. Tailwind
            CSS, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are my playgrounds, and I know them
            inside out. When it comes to deployment, you'll find me navigating
            Vercel, GitHub, and the vast Google Cloud with ease. I have a soft
            spot for WordPress and SEO â€“ they're like old friends. If you ever
            need some Python magic or a bit of web scraping wizardry, I'm your
            guy. Let's create some digital magic together!
